# AI Security Internship Presentations

This repository contains all the PowerPoint presentations created and presented during my internship.  
The presentations focus on **AI Security**, covering risks, attacks, and defenses across the AI lifecycle, with demonstrations implemented using the **Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)** and **Streamlit**.

   - Mitigation strategies to secure AI systems.  

3. **FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) Attack**  
   - Explanation of adversarial perturbations.  
   - Demo of FGSM attack on ML models.  

4. **Evasion Attacks using ART**

## ðŸ’» Demo

The demos described in the last four presentations (Evasion, Poisoning, Inference, Extraction) are implemented and available in this GitHub repository:

[HYPATIA APP](https://github.com/reemzouhby/Hypatia-ML)

You can clone the repo and follow the instructions in its README to run the interactive demos locally using Streamlit.


## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This repository **does not include live demos**, only **explanations of how the attacks were implemented**.  
- All demos were implemented using **ART** and **Streamlit** during the internship is on
